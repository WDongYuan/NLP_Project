Clinton Drew "Clint" Dempsey /ˈdɛmpsi/ (born March 9, 1983) is an American professional soccer player who plays for Seattle Sounders FC in Major League Soccer and has served as the captain of the United States national team.
His older brother Ryan was offered a tryout for the Dallas Texans, an elite youth soccer club, and brought Clint, who was noticed and recruited while passing time juggling a ball on the sidelines.
Music
One of Dempsey's passions outside of soccer is hip hop music.
The title is '196'.
The song's video is dedicated to his sister Jennifer, who, at age 16, was suddenly struck with a fatal brain aneurysm.
In 2004, Dempsey was drafted by Major League Soccer club New England Revolution, where he quickly integrated himself into the starting lineup.
New England Revolution
New England Revolution selected Clint Dempsey eighth overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft.
He has also played for New England Revolution, Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur.
Personal life
Dempsey is married to Bethany Keegan Dempsey.
Using the alias "Deuce," he, along with fellow Texas rappers XO and the late Houston rapper Big Hawk from the Screwed Up Click, is featured rapping the song "Don't Tread" in a Nike soccer advertising campaign for the 2006 World Cup with the intention to showcase both the sport's working-class roots and the United States team ahead of the World Cup.
On June 12, 2010, Dempsey became the second American (after Brian McBride) to score in more than one World Cup when he scored the equalizer goal against England in the Americans' first game of the 2010 World Cup after the England goalkeeper Robert Green made a major error.
