Anders Celsius
The observatory of Anders Celsius, from a contemporary engraving.
He further gave a rule for the determination of the boiling point if the barometric pressure deviates from a certain standard pressure  History of the Celsius temperature scale .
Anders Celsius was the first to perform and publish careful experiments aiming at the definition of an international temperature scale on scientific grounds.
Anders Celsius (November 27, 1701   April 25, 1744) was a Swedish astronomer.
He determined the dependence of the boiling of water with atmospheric pressure (in excellent agreement with modern data).
His thermometer had 100 for the freezing point of water and 0 for the boiling point.
Celsius founded the Uppsala Astronomical Observatory in 1741, and in 1742 he proposed the Celsius temperature scale in a paper to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
The Celsius crater on the Moon is named after him.
